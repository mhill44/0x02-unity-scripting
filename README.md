# 0x02. Unity - Scripting

Repo for my 0x02 - unity - scripting pnroject.

heres theh build notes / instructions as i did them:

0. Inside the maze scene, create a Sphere GameObject named Player with a Rigidbody component.

Position: (23, 1.2, 16)
Scale: (2, 2, 2)
Material Name: player
Material Color: #0000FFFF

File: Assets/maze.unity, Assets/Materials/player.mat

1. Bust a move

Create a directory Scripts. In this directory, create a new C# script called PlayerController.cs. Attach this script to the Player object. Within this script, update the Start() and FixedUpdate() functions to allow the Player to move when either the WASD or arrow keys are pressed

Movement should only be on the X and Z axes – the Player should not be able to jump.
There are many ways to create player movement depending on the way you want your player to behave. The way you implement player movement is up to you, as long as it is possible for Player to move through the maze.
Create a public float speed variable that can be edited in the Inspector to easily modify the Player‘s speed. The value of the Player’s speed is entirely up to you and how you implement player movement.

2. Camera ready

Move the Main Camera to position (22, 26, 7). Create a new C# script in the Scripts directory called CameraController.cs.

The script should have a public GameObject player variable that can be edited from the Inspector window.
The camera should follow the Player as it moves. In other words, when the player moves, the camera’s Transform position should also change relative to the Player.
The camera’s position should remain at a constant offset from the Player‘s position.
The camera does not need to rotate.

3. Insert coin
   mandatory
   Create a new Cylinder GameObject named Coin.

Position: (27, 1.7, 24)
Rotation: (0, 0, 90)
Scale: (1, .05, .8)
Material Name: coin
Material Color: #FFFF00FF
Tag: Pickup
The Coin‘s Collider component should have Is Trigger checked (Why?)
Turn Coin into a prefab inside a directory called Prefabs

4. Coin collecting
   mandatory
   Create a new C# script called Rotator.cs and attach it to Coin.

Within the Update() function, change the x value of the Coin‘s rotation to 45 over time.
Hint: Time.deltaTime
Add a new private int score variable to your PlayerController script. Set the initial value of score to 0.

Add the following new function to the script:

Prototype: void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
This function should increment the value of score when the Player touches an object tagged Pickup
Write the new value of score to the console using Debug.Log() with the format Score: <value>
The Coin object should be disabled or destroyed after the Player touches it
Place at least 20 total Coins within the maze in any X / Z position you like, as long as they are visible to the player. Keep the Y position at 1.7 to ensure the player can reach them.

Create an empty GameObject named Coins to contain all the Coin objects in the Hierarchy window. Make sure the new empty GameObject’s Scale values are all set to 1 before dragging the Coin objects into the Coins object to avoid issues with the coins’ scaling and rotation.

5. Danger zone
   mandatory
   Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
   Create a new Plane GameObject named Trap.

Position: (9.5, 0.26, 27)
Scale: (0.5, 1, 0.5)
Material Name: trap
Material Color: #FF0000FF
Tag: Trap
The Trap‘s Collider component should have Convex and Is Trigger checked (Why?)
Turn Trap into a prefab inside the Prefabs directory

6. You've activated my trap card
   mandatory
   Add a new public int health variable to your PlayerController.cs script. Set the initial value of health to 5.

Add to the existing void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) function:

This function should decrement the value of health when the Player touches an object tagged Trap
Write the new value of health to the console using Debug.Log() with the format Health: <value>
Place at least 8 total Traps within the maze in any X / Z position you like, as long as they are visible to the player. Keep the Y position at 0.26 to ensure the player can touch them.

Create an empty GameObject named Traps to contain all the Trap objects in the Hierarchy window.

7. The finish line
   mandatory
   Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
   Create a new Plane GameObject named Goal.

Position: (-27, 0.26, 1.8)
Scale: (0.5, 1, 0.5)
Material Name: goal
Material Color: #00FF00FF
Tag: Goal
The Goal‘s Collider component should have Convex and Is Trigger checked

8. Goaaaaaaaaaaal
   mandatory
   In PlayerController.cs, add to the existing void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) function:

When the Player touches an object tagged Goal, write You win! to the console using Debug.Log()

GitHub repository: 0x02-unity-scripting
File: Assets/maze.unity, Assets/Scripts/PlayerController.cs

9. Game over
   mandatory
   Create an Update() function within PlayerController.cs.

This function should check if health equals 0. If it does, write Game Over! to the console using Debug.Log()
If health equals 0, reload the scene so that the Player starts again from the beginning
The Player‘s health and score should reset to their original values
You may have issues with the lighting preview in Unity when testing and reloading your scene. For more information, watch Fix Lighting Going Dark in the Unity Editor When Resetting a Scene
